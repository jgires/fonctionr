\arguments{
\item{tab}{dataframe with the variables to be ploted.}

\item{var}{The variable in tab with the labels of the indicators to be ploted.}

\item{value}{The variable in tab with the values of the indicator to be ploted.}

\item{error_low}{The variable in tab that is the lower bound of the confidence interval. If either error_low or error_upp is NULL error bars are not shown on the graphic.}

\item{error_upp}{The variable in tab that is the upper bound of the confidence interval. If either error_low or error_upp is NULL error bars are not shown on the graphic.}

\item{facet}{A variable in tab defining the faceting group, if applicable. Default is NULL.}

\item{n_var}{The variable in tab containing the number of observation per for each indicator. Default is NULL, not showing the number of observation on the plot.}

\item{pvalue}{The p-value to show in the caption. It can a numeric value or the pvalue object from a statsistical test.}

\item{reorder}{TRUE if you want to reorder var according to value. FALSE if you do not want to reorder. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_value}{TRUE if you want to show the values of value on the graphic. FALSE if you do not want to show the proportion. Default is TRUE.}

\item{name_total}{Name of the var label that may contain the total. When indicated, it is displayed separately on the graph.}

\item{scale}{Denominator of the proportion. Default is 100 to interprets numbers as percentages.}

\item{digits}{Numbers of digits showed on the values labels on the graphic. Default is 0.}

\item{unit}{The unit showd on the plot. Default is percent.}

\item{dec}{Decimal mark shown on the graphic. Default is ","}

\item{pal}{Colour of the bars.}

\item{dodge}{Width of the bar, between 0 and 1.}

\item{font}{Font used in the graphic. See load_and_active_fonts() for available fonts.}

\item{wrap_width_y}{Number of characters before going to the line. Applies to the labels var. Default is 25.}

\item{title}{Title of the graphic.}

\item{subtitle}{Subtitle of the graphic.}

\item{xlab}{X label on the graphic. As coord_flip() is used in the graphic, xlab refers to the x label on the graphic, after the coord_flip(), and not to var in tab.}

\item{ylab}{Y label on the graphic. As coord_flip() is used in the graphic, ylab refers to the y label on the graphic, after the coord_flip(), and not to value in tab.}

\item{caption}{Caption of the graphic.}

\item{theme}{Theme od te graphic. IWEPS adds y axis lines and ticks.}
