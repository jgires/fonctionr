\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe or an object from the survey package or an object from the srvyr package.}

\item{quali_var}{The discrete variable that is described.}

\item{facet}{A variable defining the faceting group.}

\item{filter_exp}{An expression that filters the data, preserving the design.}

\item{...}{All options possible in as_survey_design in srvyr package.}

\item{na.rm.facet}{TRUE if you want to remove observations with NA on the facet variable. FALSE if you want to create a facet with the NA value for the facet variable. Default is TRUE.}

\item{na.rm.var}{TRUE if you want to remove observations with NA on the discrete variable. FALSE if you want to create a modality with the NA value for the discrete variable. Default is TRUE.}

\item{probs}{Vector of probabilities for H0 of the statistical test, in the correct order (will be rescaled to sum to 1). If probs = NULL, no statistical test is performed. Default is NULL.}

\item{prop_method}{Type of proportion method to use to compute confidence intervals. See svyciprop in survey package for details. Default is the beta method.}

\item{reorder}{TRUE if you want to reorder the categories according to their proportion. NA value, in case if na.rm.group = FALSE, is not included in the reorder. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_ci}{TRUE if you want to show the error bars on the graphic. FALSE if you do not want to show the error bars. Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_n}{TRUE if you want to show on the graphic the number of individuals in the sample in each modality of quali_var. FALSE if you do not want to show this number. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_value}{TRUE if you want to show the proportion of each category on the graphic. FALSE if you do not want to show the proportion. Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_labs}{TRUE if you want to show axes, titles and caption labels. FALSE if you do not want to show any label on axes and titles. Default is TRUE.}

\item{scale}{Denominator of the proportion. Default is 100 to interprets numbers as percentages.}

\item{digits}{Numbers of digits showed on the values labels on the graphic. Default is 0.}

\item{unit}{Unit showed in the graphic. Default is percent.}

\item{dec}{Decimal mark shown on the graphic. Depends on lang: "," for fr and nl ; "." for en.}

\item{pal}{Colour of the bars. NA bar, in case if na.rm.group = FALSE, and total bar are always in grey.}

\item{dodge}{Width of the bar, between 0 and 1. Default is 0.9.}

\item{font}{Font used in the graphic. See load_and_active_fonts() for available fonts.}

\item{wrap_width_y}{Number of characters before going to the line in the labels of the categories. Default is 25.}

\item{title}{Title of the graphic.}

\item{subtitle}{Subtitle of the graphic.}

\item{xlab}{X label on the graphic. As coord_flip() is used in the graphic, xlab refers to the X label on the graphic, after the coord_flip(), and not to the x variable in the data. If xlab = NULL, X label on the graphic will be "Distribution (total : 100 percent)". To show no X label, use xlab = "".}

\item{ylab}{Y label on the graphic. As coord_flip() is used in the graphic, ylab refers to the Y label on the graphic, after the coord_flip(), and not to the Y variable in the data. If ylab = NULL, Y label on the graphic will be quali_var. To show no Y label, use ylab = "".}

\item{lang}{The language of the indications on the chart. Possibilities: "fr", "nl", "en". Default is "fr".}

\item{caption}{Caption in the graphic.}

\item{theme}{Theme of the graphic. IWEPS adds y axis lines and ticks.}

\item{export_path}{Path to export the results in an xlsx file. The file includes three sheets : the table, the graphic and the statistical test (if probs is not NULL).}
}
