\examples{
# Loading data
data(eusilc, package = "laeken")

# Loading srvyr
library(srvyr)

# Making srvyr object
eusilc_srvyr <- as_survey_design(eusilc, ids = db030, strata = db040, weights = rb050)

# computing srvyr result using summarise()
result_srvyr<-eusilc_srvyr \%>\%
 group_by(rb090,pb220a) \%>\% # by sex and nationality
   summarise(mean_eqIncome = survey_mean(eqIncome),mean_age =survey_mean(age))

# Showing the srvyr summirise output
result_srvyr

# Pivoting the out with pivot_longer_survey()
   pivoted_result <- pivot_longer_survey(result_srvyr, n_groups = 2)

# Output is pivoted
