\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe or an object from the survey package or an object from the srvyr package.}

\item{quanti_exp}{An expression that define the variable to be described.}

\item{type}{"mean" to compute mean as the central value ; "median" to compute median as the central valu.}

\item{filter_exp}{An expression that filters the data, preserving the design.}

\item{...}{All options possible in as_survey_design in srvyr package.}

\item{quantiles}{quantiles to be computed in the distribution. Default are deciles.}

\item{bw}{Default is 1.}

\item{resolution}{Resolution of the density curve. Default is 1024.}

\item{limits}{Limits of the x axe of the graphic. Does not apply to the computation. Default is NULL to show the entire distribution on the graphic.}

\item{show_mid_line}{TRUE if you want to show the mean or median (depending on type) as a line on the graphic. FALSE if you do not want to show it. Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_ci_lines}{TRUE if you want to show confidence interval (confidence level of 95%) of the mean or median (depending on type) as lines on the graphic. FALSE if you do not want to show it as lines. Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_ci_area}{TRUE if you want to show confidence interval (confidence level of 95%) of the mean or median (depending on type) as a coloured area on the graphic. FALSE if you do not want to show it as an area. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_quant_lines}{TRUE if you want to show quantiles as lines on the graphic. FALSE if you do not want to show them as lines. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_n}{TRUE if you want to show on the graphic the number of individuals in the sample in each quantile FALSE if you do not want to show the numbers. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_value}{TRUE if you want to show the mean/median (depending on type) on the graphic. FALSE if you do not want to show the mean/median. Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_lab}{TRUE if you want to show axes, titles and caption labels. FALSE if you do not want to show any label on axes and titles. Default is TRUE.}

\item{digits}{Numbers of digits showed on the value labels on the graphic. Default is 0.}

\item{unit}{Unit showed on the graphic. Default is no unit.}

\item{dec}{Decimal mark shown on the graphic. Default is ",".}

\item{pal}{color of the density curve. maybe one color or a vector with several colors.}

\item{color}{to be completed}

\item{font}{Font used in the graphic. Available fonts, included in the package itself, are "Roboto", "Montserrat" and "Gotham Narrow". Default is "Roboto".}

\item{title}{Title of the graphic.}

\item{subtitle}{Subtitle of the graphic.}

\item{xlab}{X label on the graphic. As coord_flip() is used in the graphic, xlab refers to the X label on the graphic, after the coord_flip(), and not to the x variable in the data. If xlab = NULL, X label on the graphic will be "Moyenne : " + quanti_exp or "MÃ©dianne : " + quanti_exp. To show no X label, use xlab = "".}

\item{ylab}{Y label on the graphic. As coord_flip() is used in the graphic, ylab refers to the Y label on the graphic, after the coord_flip(), and not to the y variable in the data. If ylab = NULL, Y label on the graphic will be group. To show no Y label, use ylab = "".}

\item{caption}{Caption of the graphic.}

\item{export_path}{Path to export the results in an xlsx file. The file includes three sheets : the table, the graphic and the statistical test.}
}
\value{
A list that contains a table (tab), a graphic (garph) and a density table (dens) and a quantile table (quant)
}
\description{
Function to describe a continuous variable from complex survey data
}
